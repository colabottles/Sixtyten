This is just an introduction in a condensed form. Just a minor basic level overview of the cascade.

[The CSS Cascade Level 4 Spec states](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-4/#cascading);

<blockquote cite="CSS Cascade Level 4 Spec">The cascade takes a unordered list of declared values for a given property on a given element, sorts them by their declarationâ€™s precedence, and outputs a single cascaded value.</blockquote>

There is an order in which selectors are prioritized. Importance, specificity, and source order.

Let's go over each priority starting with importance.

### Importance

An important declaration takes precedence over a normal declaration. Such as;

```css
* {
  background-color: white;
}
body {
  background-color: red !important;
}
```

1. Transition declarations. <span class="pre">transition-timing-function: steps(6, end);</span>
2. Important user agent declarations.

```css
input, textarea, keygen, select, button, meter, progress { 
  -webkit-writing-mode: horizontal-tb !important; 
}
```

3. Important user declarations. <span class="pre">p { text-indent: 1em !important; }</span>
4. Important author declarations. <span class="pre">p { text-indent: 1.5em !important; }</span>
5. Animation declarations.

```css
@keyframes slide-right {
  50% {
    margin-left: 110px;
    opacity: 0.9;
  }

  to {
    margin-left: 200px;
  }
}
```
6. Normal author declarations. <span class="pre">p { text-indent: 1.5em; }</span>
7. Normal user declarations. <span class="pre">p { text-indent: 1em; }</span>
8. Normal user agent declarations. <span class="pre">keygen, select { border-radius: 5px; }</span>
