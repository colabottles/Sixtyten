Hi, I'm Todd. I am a Web Developer &amp; Designer as well as an Accessibility Advocate.

I have over twenty two years of experience with the web. I have experience in a number of web technologies, including:

HTML/CSS/Sass/JS, Accessibility - WCAG 2.1 A/AA/AAA, Section 508, WAI-ARIA Compliance, PHP, SQL, Git, CLI, JSON, AJAX, REST/APIs, Drupal, WordPress, Eleventy, Jekyll, Gatsby, React, Node, Mobile First, Responsive Web Design, Grunt/Gulp, Jest, Postman, Rails, UX Research/Writing, Wireframing, Analytics, and Technical Writing.

I am also a member of the W3C Silver Community, Functional Needs, XR, Visual Contrast of Text, and Error Handling subgroups.

It all started with seeing a Commodore PET running Oregon Trail in fifth grade. That fascination with moving pixels on a computer screen led to a Commodore64 and the user manual that came with it and programming in BASIC.

I have a passion for the web and making things on the web. Taking things apart and re-building them. I am interested in a lot of different things, mainly outdoors, food, and travel. Photography, typography, design and User Experience. Web conferences and meeting people in the web industry.

My past skills include PHP, Perl, SQL, ColdFusion (CFML), and Ruby/Rails to name a few. I have experience using many content management systems, namely WordPress (since it was forked from b2/Cafelog), Drupal, and a host of others. Open source experience and design. Branding experience with the Adobe Creative Cloud and such programs as QuarkXPress, Maya, Cinema4D, and Final Cut Pro.

I have never settled for being an "expert" in just one area and have always dabbled in many. Which is why I have a host of experience with hardware and software over the years. My thirst to learn in great and it started as a kid and continues right up to this very day.

Thanks for reading and [use the contact form to get in touch](https://toddl.dev/contact/) so we can talk about whatever questions you may have or maybe about me filling a role at your company. I am also willing (very willing if it a warm climate) to relocate.
