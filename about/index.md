## What is &quot;sixtyten&quot;&quest;
      
sixtyten is a personal tech/programming/design blog.

## What was the inspiration behind this site&quest;

First, [the navigation by Reggie Bowers].(https://codepen.io/bowersrd/#)So I had to have that navigation.

Brenda Storer has some awesome pens. Like the ones I forked to do the layout. [This pen](https://codepen.io/brendamarienyc/pen/oZMxOY), and [this pen](https://codepen.io/brendamarienyc/pen/BRyQzg), and [this pen](https://codepen.io/brendamarienyc/pen/VXKrqL).

Last, I found [this pen](https://codepen.io/liamj/pen/yrEXNx) which I thought was a cool animation so I forked that pen from Liam.

They put in the work, I just ran with it. Or modified it just a wee bit. Either eway, they are the heroes you deserve.
      
I changed a few things, added a couple more areas on the index page, added a few transitions, made sure everything adheres to WCAG 2.0 AA guidelines, changed some fonts, and kept the overall structure of these templates. 

###  I take no credit for the layout.

I found these pens, loved them, and wanted to use and implement them. So I did.
