## Hi There! Let's get right to it!

I'm Todd. I've been working on the web for around twenty years or so. I care about the web. I care about clean, reusable, semantic code that produced stunning, accessible sites. I care about the user. I make sites for the user and no one else. You need me on your team and here's why. I give a damn about the web and below is what I know.
