## Hi There!

I'm Todd. I've been a Front End Developer for around twenty years or so. I started by learning BASIC as a young lad and my fascination with the internet and programming and building things on the web took off from there. My focus has been primarily on accessibility(a11y), user experience and interfaces, web standards and semantic code (HTML, CSS, JS), a lot of backend work with PHP, some Rails and even a bit of ASP.

I've done a lot of different roles as a one-man team over the years, I've worked in teams that were in-house and spread all over the world in different locations. Being able to coordinate with others in different time zones was fascinating and easy to do, and I have worked by myself doing many roles in one over the course of a project.

I took a long break in 2001-2006. Over the years, many projects have changed or simply disappeared. Howvere, I do know what I am doing and I am constantly trying to learn new technologies. making the web a better place for all through inclusion and diversity is something I would like to see happen in my lifetime as well.

So here is the jist of you are looking to add a team member to your staff. Below is what I know, but there's no limit to what I can know and use. The way I learn is through doing. Repetitive doing is how I learn and that's how I do it. Thanks for reading.
