It's finally time for me to walk away from the web. There is no longer nothing for me here. Only exhaustion, exasperation, and continuous rejection. I'm tired, I'm defeated, I'm empty.

I thank everyone, whom along the way, helped carve my journey, who taught me invaluable lessons, and whom I met and enjoyed a coffee, a meal, conversation, or moment with. There are too many to list, so I will just say thank you all.

It's not fun anymore. I don't have any prospects for anything job related to get me out of where I am now.

It is time for me to go.

Thank you all.
