## Who are you&quest;

I'm Todd. I'm a Senior Front End Developer, been around the web for about twenty years or so. I love creating and making things, I love the web and learning, and I am self-taught. I'm a huge supporter of accessibility and web standards.

I'm also a big proponent of the front end web developer and the work they put into the web. That's another story. Front End Developers are programmers/developers no matter what kind of spin anyone tries to put on it.

I currently work for a company as a Web Developer/Lead Support Technician. It's been over three years since I have been there. I am also available for work, relocation, and I am sharpening my skills int eh areas of JavaScript and User Experience.

I love to travel, write and read, go to web conferences, meet new people, and talk web. Lobster rolls from Maine are the best.

This is my personal tech/programming/design blog. I hope you enjoy.

## What was the inspiration behind this site&quest;

I wanted to do a site using CSS Grid after hearing the talks and reading the articles from Rachel Andrew and Jen Simmons. I am currently working on the beta for my new Grid-based layout "theme".

First, [the navigation by Reggie Bowers](https://codepen.io/bowersrd/#). So I had to have that navigation.

Brenda Storer has some awesome pens. Like the ones I forked to do the layout. [This pen](https://codepen.io/brendamarienyc/pen/oZMxOY), and [this pen](https://codepen.io/brendamarienyc/pen/BRyQzg), and [this pen](https://codepen.io/brendamarienyc/pen/VXKrqL).

Last, I found [this pen](https://codepen.io/liamj/pen/yrEXNx) which I thought was a cool animation so I forked that pen from Liam.

They put in the work, I just ran with it. Or modified it just a wee bit. Either way, they are the heroes you deserve.

I changed a few things, added a couple more areas on the index page, added a few transitions, made sure everything adheres to WCAG 2.0 AA guidelines, changed some fonts, and kept the overall structure of these templates.

### I take no credit for the layout

I found these pens, loved them, and wanted to use and implement them. So I did.
