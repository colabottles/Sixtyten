## UX Burlington 2019. Burlington, VT

### My First UX Burlington

While scanning the countryside for conferences in the New England area, I was drawn to UX Burlington. So I snagged a ticket. Best decision I made that week.

### Morning Keynote

Victor Yocco gave the morning keynote. Designing For Short Attention Spans.

### Frédéric Harper

The first speaker that I saw on the developer track was Frédéric Harper, Building Web Apps That Don’t Suck.

### Henri Helvetica

The next speaker was Henri Helvetica, Planet of the APIs: A Tale of Performance and UX.

### Chris DeMars

Chris DeMars was the last speaker for the day with Focusing on Focus. He nailed it.

### Dr. Robert Moore

Witht the closing keynote on a great one-day conference was Dr. Robert Moore and Conversational UX.
