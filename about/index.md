## Who are you

I'm Todd. I'm a web designer. I've been around the web for about twenty years or so. I love creating and making things, I love the web and learning. I'm a huge supporter of accessibility and UX. You can use the contact form to contact me or find me on Twitter. I don't do much out of the web scene. I love to travel, write and read, go to web conferences, meet new people and talk web. Lobster rolls from Maine are the best. I'm also a big proponent of the front end web developer and the work they put into the web. That's another story.

## What is "sixtyten"

sixtyten is a personal tech/programming/design blog. The name is a working name&hellip; I'll rename it when I get a domain.

## What was the inspiration behind this site

First, [the navigation by Reggie Bowers](https://codepen.io/bowersrd/#). So I had to have that navigation.

Brenda Storer has some awesome pens. Like the ones I forked to do the layout. [This pen](https://codepen.io/brendamarienyc/pen/oZMxOY), and [this pen](https://codepen.io/brendamarienyc/pen/BRyQzg), and [this pen](https://codepen.io/brendamarienyc/pen/VXKrqL).

Last, I found [this pen](https://codepen.io/liamj/pen/yrEXNx) which I thought was a cool animation so I forked that pen from Liam.

They put in the work, I just ran with it. Or modified it just a wee bit. Either way, they are the heroes you deserve.

I changed a few things, added a couple more areas on the index page, added a few transitions, made sure everything adheres to WCAG 2.0 AA guidelines, changed some fonts, and kept the overall structure of these templates.

### I take no credit for the layout

I found these pens, loved them, and wanted to use and implement them. So I did. If the authors of the pens do not want me using them, I will change things no questions asked.
