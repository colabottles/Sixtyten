## What is &quot;sixtyten&quot;&quest;
      
sixtyten is a personal tech/programming/design blog.

## What was the inspiration behind this site&quest;

First, the navigation by Reggie Bowers. <a href="https://codepen.io/bowersrd/#">So I had to have that navigation</a>.

Brenda Storer has some awesome pens. Like the ones I forked to do the layout. <a href="https://codepen.io/brendamarienyc/pen/oZMxOY">This pen</a>, and <a href="https://codepen.io/brendamarienyc/pen/BRyQzg">this pen</a>, and <a href="https://codepen.io/brendamarienyc/pen/VXKrqL">this pen</a>.

Last, I found <a href="https://codepen.io/liamj/pen/yrEXNx">this pen</a> which I thought was a cool animation so I forked that pen from Liam.

They put in the work, I just ran with it. Or modified it just a wee bit. Either eway, they are the heroes you deserve.
      
I changed a few things, added a couple more areas on the index page, added a few transitions, made sure everything adheres to WCAG 2.0 AA guidelines, changed some fonts, and kept the overall structure of these templates. 

###  I take no credit for the layout.

I found these pens, loved them, and wanted to use and implement them. So I did.
