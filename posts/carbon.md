I came across Carbon on Twitter (exactly where escapes me. Again.) when I came across a tweet where there was code shared via Carbon. I thought it was pretty cool and a great way to share code.

[Carbon](https://carbon.now.sh/) is (taken from the website) where you can &ldquo;create and share beautiful images of your source code.&rdquo;

<blockquote cite="Carbon">You know all of those code screenshots you see on Twitter? Although the code's usually impressive, we saw room for improvement in the aesthetic department. Carbon is the easiest way to create beautiful images of your source code. So what are you waiting for? Go impress all of your followers with your newfound design prowess.</blockquote>

Plain and simple.

You can set the color scheme of the image where it uses themes from zsh and terminal color themes, the language you want to use (CSS, Clojure, Twig, Vue, etc.) and wish to share, there are different presets and you can customize the image, with options to tweet it or export it using some different settings.

If you want an easy way to share code snippets, this is the way!
