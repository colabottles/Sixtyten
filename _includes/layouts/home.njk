    <h2>Greetings!</h2>
    <p>Welcome! I am Todd, I am a web designer &amp; developer from South Portland, Maine and I love creating things on the web. This is my personal site where I write about technology, web, and other things I run across. I may also write about my misadventures when traveling. Have a look around and enjoy!</p>

        <h3>I have an obsession with learning things on the web. I am currently re-sharpening my Vanilla JavaScript skills, learning Vue and React, playing around with Gatsby, immersed in some User Experience courses. I just finished and became certified in a W3C Introduction to Accessibility course and I am very passionate about accessibility on the web as well as diversity and inclusion. Some say it is a sickness, I say it is just another day at the office.</h3>
