## UX Burlington 2019. Burlington, VT

### My First UX Burlington

While scanning the countryside for conferences in the New England area, I was drawn to UX Burlington. So I snagged a ticket. Best decision I made that week. More on the food that I had there on Church Street as well.

### Morning Keynote

Victor Yocco gave the morning keynote. &ldquo;Designing For Short Attention Spans&rdquo;. A great way to kick off the conference. Filled with humor, light-heartedness and information, I was glad I had attended because this keynote made me think about a lot of UX things I've been dealing with at work.

Three main points of the talk were:

1. What's an Attention Span?
2. Decision Making Heuristics
3. Tactical Design Elements

We all have an attention span that is less than that of a goldfish. Designers need to care about their users' attention though. Victor touched upon the questions we have to be asking not only our team and stakeholders, but for our users as well.App

<blockquote cite="Victor Yocco">Designing to gain people's attention comes with great responsibility. Why do you want that, what are you doing that's contributing to making their lives better if they're going to give you their attention?</blockquote>

A lot of tech giants need to start asking themselves that very question.App

Some of the many points touched on in the fantastic morning keynote were;

1. We need to capture users' attention.
2. We need to understand why we want and deserve users' attention.
3. We must navigate ethical decisions and issues when we design for attention.
4. We need to conduct research with users.
5. Users can't pay close attention to each decision.
6. Heuristics are mental shortcutsfor making decisions.
7. Accounting for heuristics may increase user adoption and decrease mental load.

Some key points on the Tactical Design Elements were;

1. Clear the clutter.
2. Remove distractions.
3. Animation. What is the goal of it?
4. Give users something to do.

There was so much to Victor's talk, it would take me a day to just relay the vast amount of information that was crammed into a 48-minute video. I had three pages of notes myself, so I'll just suggest people watch the video of the keynote. The link to [the video for Victor's keynote can be found here](https://youtu.be/6WBS6YYMAcE) on the UX Burlington YouTube account.

### Frédéric Harper

The first speaker that I saw on the developer track was Frédéric Harper, &ldquo;Building Web Apps That Don’t Suck&rdquo;. Frédéric spoke about tips and tricks to help you optimize your applications. Create a great experience for your users that is fast and with quality. It was a great way to kick off the developer track for sure.

Frédéric touched upon mobile first, engagement with mobile apps. Why are you using the application? Keep your users engaged with a great UI.

Think about content, think about the comfort zone of the screen and what users ahve to do to navigate your app and he even broke into a little condensed version of Fitt's Law. Fitt's Law, for those who don't know, is a predictive model of human movement primarily used in human–computer interaction and ergonomics. Basically, the law predicts that the time required to rapidly move to a target area is a function of the ratio between the distance to the target and the width of the target.

Minimizing large files, file requests, HTTP requests, using a CDN, running the audit on Webhint, don't make users think about the interface, insulate them from the complexities and make our goals easier and faster. There was an awful lot of information packed into the hour and I'll point you to [Frédéric's video on the UX Burlington YouTube page](https://youtu.be/DWd5cL3ViTY). I highly suggest watching.

### Henri Helvetica

The next speaker was Henri Helvetica, &ldquo;Planet of the APIs: A Tale of Performance and UX&rdquo;.

### Chris DeMars

Chris DeMars was the last speaker for the day with &ldquo;Focusing on Focus&rdquo;. He nailed it.

### Dr. Robert Moore

Witht the closing keynote on a great one-day conference was Dr. Robert Moore and Conversational UX.
